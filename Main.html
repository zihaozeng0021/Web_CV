                        Hi!
                        <br>My name is Zihao Zeng.
                        <br>A blend of introspective and occasionally absent-minded.
                        <br>Currently, I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Manchester.
                        <br>I am deeply inspired by minimalism, striving for clarity and simplicity in both my lifestyle and personal philosophy.
                        <br>My primary research focus revolves around leveraging advanced machine learning methodologies to tackle challenges in financial applications.
